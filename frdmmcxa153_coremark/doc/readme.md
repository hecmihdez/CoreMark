# CoreMark Benchmark - FRDM-MCXA153

## What is CoreMark?

**CoreMark** is a benchmark developed by **EEMBC (Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium)** to measure the performance of CPUs in embedded systems. It targets operations commonly found in real embedded workloads, such as:

- Linked list manipulation
- Matrix operations
- Integer math
- CRC (cyclic redundancy check)

CoreMark is designed to be portable, consistent, and reliable for comparing embedded processor performance.

## About this project

This project implements the CoreMark benchmark on the **FRDM-MCXA153** development board (NXP MCX A153, ARM Cortex-M33 core). In addition to running the benchmark once, the application has been extended to:

- **Periodically execute the CoreMark benchmark**, using a configurable interval defined by the macro `EXECUTION_TIME_FREQ` (in seconds).
- Use the **LPTMR (Low-Power Timer)** to schedule benchmark executions at runtime without blocking the main application.
- **Read the internal temperature** of the microcontroller at the time of each benchmark run.
- **Print benchmark results and temperature via serial terminal**.
- **Store each result in flash memory** for later inspection or logging.

## Requirements

- **FRDM-MCXA153** development board
- Tools:
  - [MCUXpresso IDE](https://www.nxp.com/mcuxpresso/ide)
  - USB drivers and debug probe support
- MCX A153 SDK (via NXPâ€™s SDK Builder)
- Micro-USB cable
- Serial terminal software (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term)

### View the benchmark results

1. Open a serial terminal and connect to the correct COM port:
   - Baud rate: **115200**
   - 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)
2. Reset the board or press the reset button.
3. You will see CoreMark benchmark output, including:
   - Total execution time
   - Iterations per second
   - CRC values (to verify validity)

---

### Configure the execution interval

The interval between CoreMark executions is set via the `EXECUTION_TIME_FREQ` macro:

#define EXECUTION_TIME_FREQ 60  // Execute every 60 seconds
